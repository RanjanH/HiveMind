## Problem Statement

In every educational institution, the effective coordination of numerous student committees, spanning technical, cultural, and social domains, is essential. However, conducting events within these committees presents a complex challenge. It involves navigating through approval processes across different departments and authorities, securing venue permissions, and ensuring seamless scheduling that avoids conflicts with other events and lectures.

Consider the scenario of the Agnethon. To proceed, approvals from the Prinicipal, the Dean of Student Affairs, the Head of Department(H.O.D) and our Faculty Mentor are essential. This all should be possible from a single platform.

### Key Features :
..* Different committees need a way to set up events and get approvals from the right college departments.
..* Students should also have a way to join in on these events and stay in the loop about what's happening on campus.
..* Committees should be able to check out when rooms and venues are available so that events don't accidentally overlap.
